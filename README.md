# SEO Smart Assistant

A powerful desktop application built with Python and Tkinter to assist users in optimizing their websites for search engines.

- **Keyword Analysis**: Analyze keywords for difficulty, search volume, CPC, and competition, with visual charts.
- **Content Analysis**: Evaluate content for SEO metrics like word count, readability, keyword density, and heading usage.
- **URL Analysis**: Perform basic SEO audits on URLs, including title, meta description, and link analysis.
- **Keyword Rankings**: Track keyword positions with visual ranking charts.
- **Message Persistence**: Store chat history using Redis to maintain context across sessions.
- **Customizable UI**: Modern, dark-themed interface with interactive tabs and suggestion buttons for a user-friendly experience.
